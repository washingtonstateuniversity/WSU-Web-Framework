# Contributing

Welcome! Thank you for considering a contribution to the WSU Web Framework.

Before submitting a pull request, please consider discussing the proposed change in an issue, via the [WSU Web Slack](https://web.wsu.edu/slack-team/), or in an [open lab](https://web.wsu.edu/open-lab/) session.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Don't modify any version numbers, these are updated as part of the build and release process.
2. Keep your changes as focused as possible so that the change is easy to communicate.
3. We use jQuery's [JavaScript style guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/) as a base for our JavaScript linting.
4. Please make sure `grunt` runs without failure before submitting a pull request.
